<h4 id="score-reason">Score reason</h4>

<p>The building is 5min away from our current office. It has a total of 9 (ground floor plus 8 more) floors averaging 500 sqm. Parking lot is about 7 per floor.</p>

<p>The first 4 floors are totally open plan so our layout necessities can be accommodated without any problem. From floor 6 to 8 there are some offices besides the open space.</p>

<p>Perhaps renting 2 floors and then divide according to our needs. Some relax area can be designed into one open space floor and then with the open plan office; and in the other floor we can have also some open plan design plus the office that come with the floor.</p>

<p>Rent is 12USD per sqm plus VAT plus building expenses. So, it could total approximately 14.2USD per sqm. I believe this is market price for the location and size. There could be room for bargain since it has been empty last year due to the pandemic.</p>

<h4 id="comments-about-this-office">Comments about this office:</h4>

<p>It is a relatively older building if we compare with the other ones. Floors are seemed to have been under maintenance due to its useful life, that might be a sign for high potential maintenance in the future. It is all white and the view is pretty nice. It does not have a big kitchenette and there may be a need to design a bigger one. It has 2 entrances that could be handful in distributing the space.</p>
