## Score: 8

#### Score reason

The building is 5min away from our current office. It has a total of 9 (ground floor plus 8 more) floors averaging 500 sqm. Parking lot is about 7 per floor.

The first 4 floors are totally open plan so our layout necessities can be accommodated without any problem. From floor 6 to 8 there are some offices besides the open space. 

Perhaps renting 2 floors and then divide according to our needs. Some relax area can be designed into one open space floor and then with the open plan office; and in the other floor we can have also some open plan design plus the office that come with the floor.

Rent is 12USD per sqm plus VAT plus building expenses. So, it could total approximately 14.2USD per sqm. I believe this is market price for the location and size. There could be room for bargain since it has been empty last year due to the pandemic.


#### Comments about this office:

It is a relatively older building if we compare with the other ones. Floors are seemed to have been under maintenance due to its useful life, that might be a sign for high potential maintenance in the future. It is all white and the view is pretty nice. It does not have a big kitchenette and there may be a need to design a bigger one. It has 2 entrances that could be handful in distributing the space.
