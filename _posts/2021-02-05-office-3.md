## Score: 8.5

#### Score reason

The building is 10 min away from our current office. It has open plan offices that can be adapted to any company needs. The finishing of the building is high quality due to it newness. Some examples are natural granite floor, walls coated with mirror and marble, double glassed structure with thermal acoustic protection, thermo sun guard, exterior openings in anodized and tempered glass, amenities within the building such as coffee shop, top floor accessibility, gym (not currently used due to pandemic). 

It is already carpeted with plenty of bathrooms for separate sexes, very beautiful kitchenet. It has additional parking lot at USD 65 +VAT per spot.

Rent is 12.5 USD per sqm plus VAT plus building expenses. So, it could total approximately 14.5USD per sqm. I believe this is market price for the location and size. I consider there will not be room for bargaining that price.

Office B1 and B2 to connect

#### Comments about this office:

It is a much newer building if we compare with the other ones. We talked directly with the owner and seemed very collaborating to ensure clients are very satisfying with their rent needs.

One suggestion the owner mentioned is to be up to a period in AYMAC II and then move to AYMAC III which is a new tower they are building and is next to AYMAC II.
This building will be state-of-the-art with better finishing than AYMAC II.

According to the plan, AYMAC III will be finished by October this year and moving can happen perhaps at end of the year with no costs paid such as termination of contracts, etc. It could be a valid option to analyse the growth of the company with regard to the headcount, say in AYMAC II we could have up to 50 people by the end of the year and then the timing matches with the expansion of the office (more people) and the need for more space. 

In AYMAC III there are floors of 650m2, so it could be possible to rent one directly and then even get another floor if needed in accordance to the company expansion plans.

Lastly, moving to AYMAC II is virtually no costs of AA, carpet, cables and kitchen etc. given the fact that everything is already set up there. The only costs would be to open up the dividing wall (plasterboard-made) that is located in the middle of the floor which will not be that costly since only a door space will be needed to move around.
