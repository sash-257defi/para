The building has a total of 17 floors with the first 5 being parking and the floor has 8 divisions so it is not open plan; although the divisions can be re-adjusted for an open plan office.</p> <p>It has double glazed fronts floor to ceiling watertight that provide great luminosity and acoustic and thermal protection. Also, it has carpeted technical floors, Armstrong type ceilings with led luminaries, independent air conditioning, complete kitchenettes with fine finishing, 100% own electric generator, first-class elevator with cabin stainless steel and 24-hour security.</p> <p>It has amenities such as: gym, auditorium with capacity for 80 people, conference room and cafeteria in the terrace that can be used as a social gathering space. It has plenty of parking lots if there are more needs at an extra cost.</p> <p>Rent is 16.2 USD per sqm plus VAT plus building expenses. So, it could total approximately 18.7USD per sqm. I believe this is market price for the location and size because it is the largest office that we could have the opportunity to view.</p> <p>I consider there is room for bargaining that price since we can leverage the point of renting the whole floor instead of having 8 tenants, they will have just us and the fact that we could make an advance of 6 months or 1 year of rent upfront.</p> <h4 id="comments-about-this-office">Comments about this office:</h4> <p>It is a brand-new building if we compare with the other ones, it will be finished by the end of March this year. Through the real estate broker, we talked directly with the developers who are in charge of leasing/selling the units.</p> <p>The building is state-of-the-art and if we rent, we will be the first owners. It is in the financial district of Asuncion just in behind the Mall Shopping del Sol. Traffic is not that much because main avenues are one block away.</p> <p>There will a cost to be estimated to adjust the already divided spaces into an open plan office. The developer will send us how much it would cost to have the plasterboard walls/glass screens. Estimated time to finish this adjustment is less than a month, so by the end of April we could move in. Besides this point, it’s already ready to move in. All carpeted and with high class ceiling.</p> <p>It is a great option to consider since we can extend a few months our current lease and move just one block from our office and be in a much bigger office with brand new quality material. My take is that we could negotiate a great deal for the company.</p> <h4 id="layout-plan">Layout plan:</h4> <p><img src="/images/4/plan.png" /></p> <h2 id="pictures">Pictures:</h2> <h4 id="office-b1">Office B1</h4> <p><img src="/images/4/1.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/2.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/3.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/4.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/5.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/6.jpg" /></p> <p><img src="/images/4/7.jpg" /></p> <h2 id="video">Video:</h2> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMBSgRsm6jo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
